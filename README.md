# Pitch Classification Using AlexNet

This project aims to classify pitching types in baseball using deep learning techniques. Specifically, we use the AlexNet architecture to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) on a dataset of photographs of pitchers in action, with labels indicating the type of pitch thrown (e.g. fastball, curveball, slider).

The trained model can be used to automatically classify new photographs of pitchers, potentially revolutionizing the way scouting and recruiting is done in the baseball industry. By automating the process of identifying pitchers with certain pitching types, teams can more efficiently identify and recruit the players that best fit their needs.

But the use of AI in baseball doesn't stop there. From in-game strategy to fan engagement, AI is transforming the way the game is played and experienced. For example:

* In-game strategy: AI can be used to analyze the performance of pitchers, batters, and fielders in real-time, providing coaches with insights and recommendations that can inform in-game decisions. This could lead to more effective player management and more successful game outcomes.

* Fan engagement: AI can be used to create personalized experiences for fans, both in and out of the stadium. For example, using computer vision to recognize fans in the stadium, teams can send targeted messages and promotions to fans' mobile devices. Similarly, AI-powered chatbots can provide fans with customized information and recommendations based on their interests.

Overall, the use of AI in baseball is just getting started. As the technology continues to evolve, we can expect to see even more innovative applications of AI in the sport, transforming everything from player recruitment to in-game strategy and fan engagement.

Being able to identify the pitch type before the ball is thrown can be helpful in a number of ways in baseball or softball. Here are some possible benefits:

*  Better timing and anticipation: When a batter can recognize the pitch type early, they can begin their swing earlier and adjust their timing accordingly. This can give them a better chance of making solid contact with the ball.

*  Improved pitch selection: Knowing the pitch type in advance can help a batter make more informed decisions about whether to swing or not. For example, if they know a breaking ball is coming, they might be more likely to lay off a pitch that looks like it's in the strike zone but will break out of it.

*  Better strategic decisions: Knowing the pitch type can also help a team make better strategic decisions. For example, if a base runner knows a pitcher is likely to throw a breaking ball with a runner on first base, they might be more likely to steal second base because the pitcher will have a harder time throwing them out.

# Reacting versus Guessing

Being able to identify the pitch type before the ball is thrown can give batters and teams a competitive advantage in baseball 

The Houston Astros are a prime example of how having knowledge of what pitch is coming before it is thrown can lead to success for batters.

The Houston Astros' electronic sign-stealing system that was used during the 2017 season had a significant impact on the team's offensive performance.

When comparing the Astros' offensive statistics from 2016 to 2017, there is a noticeable improvement across the board. In 2016, the team had a batting average of .247, an on-base percentage of .319, and a slugging percentage of .417. However, in 2017, these statistics increased to .282, .346, and .478, respectively.

Additionally, the team's weighted on-base average (wOBA) increased from .319 to .346, and their weighted runs created plus (wRC+) increased from 102 to 121.

These improvements in the Astros' batting stats cannot be solely attributed to the electronic sign-stealing system, as there were other factors at play. Nonetheless, it is clear that the system had a significant impact on the team's offensive performance and contributed to their success in the 2017 season.

The Houston Astros gained a significant competitive advantage by having knowledge of what pitch was coming before it was thrown, which allowed their batters to adjust their swings accordingly and make better contact with the ball.

While the impact of the electronic sign-stealing system may never be fully quantified, the statistical improvements seen in the team's offensive performance suggest that it played a major role in their success during the 2017 season.

The Astros' use of this system has since been widely condemned, and the team has faced significant penalties and reputational damage as a result.

Nevertheless, the 2017 season remains a stark reminder of the potential benefits of having access to advanced data and technology in baseball, and the importance of ensuring a level playing field for all teams

# Results and Justification

To determine whether the amount of runs scored by the Astros in 2017 was unusual compared to league average, a hypothesis test was conducted.

The null hypothesis was that there was no significant difference between the Astros' runs scored in 2017 and the league average runs scored. The alternative hypothesis was that there was a significant difference between the two.

A significance level of 0.05 was chosen, meaning that if the p-value was less than 0.05, the null hypothesis would be rejected.

The data was gathered and analyzed using statistical software, which calculated the mean and standard deviation of the league's runs scored and the Astros' runs scored.

The z-score was then calculated, which measures the number of standard deviations a data point is from the mean. The z-score was found to be greater than 1.96, which is the critical value for a significance level of 0.05.

This means that the p-value was less than 0.05 and the null hypothesis was rejected. Therefore, it was concluded that the amount of runs scored by the Astros in 2017 was significantly different from the league average, indicating that their performance was unusual compared to other teams.

Here is a visualization of where the Astros 2017 run production stands compared to the league average :

The z-score calculation showed that the amount of runs scored by the Astros in 2017 was significantly different from the league average, with a z-score greater than 1.96. This indicates that the Astros' performance was quite far away from the mean, which is the expected value for the league.

The critical value for a significance level of 0.05 was 1.96, which means that there was less than a 5% chance that the observed difference in runs scored between the Astros and the league average was due to chance alone. Therefore, the null hypothesis was rejected in favor of the alternative hypothesis, which suggests that the Astros' performance was not the same as that of the rest of the league.

These results suggest that the Astros' performance was unusual and may have been influenced by other factors, such as the team's strategies, players, or external factors like weather conditions. The hypothesis test helped to determine the statistical significance of the difference in runs scored between the Astros and the league average, providing valuable insights into the team's performance during the 2017 season.

In conclusion, it is certainly possible that the results of the hypothesis test could justify the effects and advantages of this sign-stealing scheme.
