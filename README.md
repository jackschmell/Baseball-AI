# Pitch Classification Using AlexNet

This project aims to classify pitching types in baseball using deep learning techniques. Specifically, we use the AlexNet architecture to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) on a dataset of photographs of pitchers in action, with labels indicating the type of pitch thrown (e.g. fastball, curveball, slider).

The trained model can be used to automatically classify new photographs of pitchers, potentially revolutionizing the way scouting and recruiting is done in the baseball industry. By automating the process of identifying pitchers with certain pitching types, teams can more efficiently identify and recruit the players that best fit their needs.

But the use of AI in baseball doesn't stop there. From in-game strategy to fan engagement, AI is transforming the way the game is played and experienced. For example:

* In-game strategy: AI can be used to analyze the performance of pitchers, batters, and fielders in real-time, providing coaches with insights and recommendations that can inform in-game decisions. This could lead to more effective player management and more successful game outcomes.

* Fan engagement: AI can be used to create personalized experiences for fans, both in and out of the stadium. For example, using computer vision to recognize fans in the stadium, teams can send targeted messages and promotions to fans' mobile devices. Similarly, AI-powered chatbots can provide fans with customized information and recommendations based on their interests.

Overall, the use of AI in baseball is just getting started. As the technology continues to evolve, we can expect to see even more innovative applications of AI in the sport, transforming everything from player recruitment to in-game strategy and fan engagement.

Being able to identify the pitch type before the ball is thrown can be helpful in a number of ways in baseball or softball. Here are some possible benefits:

*  Better timing and anticipation: When a batter can recognize the pitch type early, they can begin their swing earlier and adjust their timing accordingly. This can give them a better chance of making solid contact with the ball.

*  Improved pitch selection: Knowing the pitch type in advance can help a batter make more informed decisions about whether to swing or not. For example, if they know a breaking ball is coming, they might be more likely to lay off a pitch that looks like it's in the strike zone but will break out of it.

*  Better strategic decisions: Knowing the pitch type can also help a team make better strategic decisions. For example, if a base runner knows a pitcher is likely to throw a breaking ball with a runner on first base, they might be more likely to steal second base because the pitcher will have a harder time throwing them out.

Being able to identify the pitch type before the ball is thrown can give batters and teams a competitive advantage in baseball 

The 2017 Houston Astros are a prime example of how having knowledge of what pitch is coming before it is thrown can lead to success for batters. It was later revealed that during the 2017 season, the Astros used a system of electronic sign stealing to decode the signs of opposing teams, allowing their batters to know what pitch was coming. This gave the Astros a significant advantage, as their batters were able to anticipate and prepare for each pitch, leading to improved batting statistics. In fact, the Astros had the highest team batting average, slugging percentage, and on-base plus slugging (OPS) in the league that season. However, the use of electronic sign stealing was against the rules and led to significant consequences for the Astros organization. Nonetheless, the 2017 Astros serve as a prominent example of the importance of pitch knowledge in hitting success.
